# Compiler
This is going to be a code compiler for my made up language TnT. So far I have begun work on two parts, the Lexer and the Parser. Their combined job is to interpret plain text files and create a ParseTree data structure to represent the plain text in a more code like structure.

## Lexer
Reads text from a file and breaks it into tokens.

## Parser
Reads tokens from a text file and parses them into a parse tree.
